# kc_dataset modelling
* The dataset is made of historic data of houses sold between 2014 to 2015 in King County, Washington State, USA. The original dataset consisted of 21 features and 21597 observations. Some of these have been dropped in the process of data cleaning.
* The objective is to create a regression model and find out which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable(price). These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between the dependent feature and one or more independent features. Apart from the modelling, I have explored some aspects of the features to check the relationship with each other and with the price.
* The repository contains the notebook, a non technical presentation and the data itself.
